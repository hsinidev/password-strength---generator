It's calculated based on the length of the password and the size of the character set it uses (e.g., uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols). Higher entropy means a password is more secure and harder to guess or brute-force."

                "@type": "Answer",
                "text": "Length is the single most important factor in password strength. Each character you add exponentially increases the number of possible combinations, making it dramatically harder for a computer to guess. A 16-character password using only lowercase letters is vastly stronger than an 8-character password with mixed character types."

The security risk of reusing weak passwords across multiple sites is far greater than the risk of using a trusted password manager."
